      <h2>Our Story</h2></div>
    <div class="story">
      <p>We have been adventuring together since our junior year of high school
         when we took our first trip to St. Petersburg, Russia to meet Taras’
         family. This was the first of many trips together in which we would discover
         our shared passion for new experiences and travel.
      </p>
      <p>Eventually, this passion would lead us from the midwest to one of the best
         states for adventuring and outdoor life: sunny Colorado. There, Taras found a
         job in technology sales and Laura worked as an occupational therapist at a traumatic
         brain injury and spinal cord injury rehabilitation hospital. We also enjoyed ski biking,
         mountain biking, camping, and riding dual sport bikes together.
      </p>

      <p>Despite having good jobs, a nice house, and a great friend group, we started to
         feel stuck in life. Stuck in a daily routine, stuck taking care of a house in which
         we didn't spend much time, and stuck in life in general. That’s when we started
         to create a new vision of what’s next for us focused on travel, freedom, and tiny living.
      </p>
      <p>In May of 2018, everything came together to allow us to take this next step. We now
        live in a 1999 Casita travel trailer with our two dogs and plan to travel throughout the
        U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
